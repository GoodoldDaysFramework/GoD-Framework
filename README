# GoD - God old Days PHP Framework

GoD is a framework designed to allow developers to thinks less of having
to update every last project they've ever built, with the sudden mischief
in the php core system developers have to update every version of their app
to match the lates .x version.

For this reason we have created =GoD= to make it seamless you only need
to 
> require_once("god.php");
and tadaaa no need to rewrite any functions :)
